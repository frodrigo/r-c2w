======
Automatic extraction of way and waterway from french vector cadastre.
By Frederic Rodrigo, 2010, AGPL3


Dependencies
============
Build
- gcc
- cmake
- cgal Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
Run
- qadastre project with land extraction support, use --convert-with-lands : http://gitorious.org/~frodrigo/qadastre/frodrigo-qadastre2osm
- ruby


Build
=====
Build poly directory, no extra dependency required.
$ cd poly
$ sh make

Build skeleton directory, need camke and cgal lib.
$ cd skeleton
$ cmake .
$ make

Build convo directory, need libboost, but already cgal dependency.
$ cd convo
$ sh make


Principle
=========
From city limit and used field extract public space. From this, compute volonoi diagram to extract street skeleton.


Usage
=====
Download and extract data from cadastre with project qadastre. Needed data for r-c2w are lands, water and city-limits.

Run r-c2w with extract osm file base name.
$ sh r-c2w.sh ../quadastre2osm/F4402-SAINTE-FOY-LA-GRANDE

All result files are in same directory as input files. There is a file for street and one for waterway as *.skel.gpx.
