======
Automatic extraction of way and waterway from french vector cadastre.
By Frederic Rodrigo, 2010-2011, AGPL3


Dependencies
============
Build
- gcc
- cmake
- cgal Computational Geometry Algorithms Library
- boost library version > 1.44 

Run
- qadastre project with land extraction support: http://gitorious.org/~frodrigo/qadastre/frodrigo-qadastre2osm
- ruby (>= version 1.9)


Build
=====
Build poly directory, no extra dependency required.
$ cd poly
$ sh make

Build skeleton directory, need camke and cgal lib.
$ cd skeleton
$ cmake .
$ make

Build convo directory, need libboost, but already cgal dependency.
$ cd convo
$ sh make


Principle
=========
From city limit and used field extract public space. From this, compute volonoi diagram to extract street skeleton.


Usage
=====
Download and extract data from cadastre with project qadastre. Needed data for r-c2w are lands, water and city-limits (use --convert-with-lands option)

Run r-c2w with extract osm file base name.
$ sh r-c2w.sh ../quadastre2osm/F4402-SAINTE-FOY-LA-GRANDE

All result files are in same directory as input files. There is a file for street and one for waterway as *.skel.gpx.

Batch Usage
===========
Obtain commune list from qadastre with:
$ Qadastre2OSM --list 011 > list

Place the list file in root directory of project. Fix QADASTRE path in r-c2w-list.sh if needed.
Then run:
$ bash r-c2w-list.sh
Now take a coffee, print walking-paper and go map New Zeland (you can take your time).
